# Prework Study Guide Website

## Description

I have begun my journey in learning how to code and as such, I wanted to create a study guide that both retains information and requires beginner coding as a practice for future projects. This was my introuduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has taught me the workflow process and has taught me to become more comfortable with Git. I will update this study guide as I learn more and it will act as a resource as my knowledge deepens. It has made me familiar with the coding basics needed to advance into the class. I know have a place where I can retain and review important information necessary to succeed in web development.

The Prework Study Guide has 4 sections (HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript) where notes are stored and available for review. If one wishes to access the DevTools console, the user can review the JavaScript and see it run. It list both the topics that have been learned and there is a function that chooses a topic for the user to study first.

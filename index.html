					<h2>CSS</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
						<li>CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a  document in HTML or XML.</li>
						<li>CSS can be embedded in the HTML file or seperate from it.</li>
						<li>CSS will by default apply to all of the HTML structure.</li>
						<li>Responsive Design is a web design approach to make web pages that render well on all screen sizes and resolutions while ensuring good usability in order to design a multi-device web.</li>
						<li>CSS Resets are a way of making the styling across browsers consistent with each other. Think the normalize file you use.</li>
						<li>Creating classes allows us to differentiate which elements are being affected by the CSS file.</li>
						<li>Pseudo-Classes in CSS is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). Think :hover, :checked, :visited.</li>
						<li>Psuedo-Elements in CSS is a keyword added to a a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s). This is symbolized with two colons (::).</li>
						<li>CSS Variables are custom properties set to a variable and declared in the :root selector and are then used throughout the CSS using the declared variable.</li>
						<li>Color is the CSS property that sets the color value.</li>

						<li>Flexbox is a module as a method that can offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment.</li>
						<li>Position is the CSS property that sets how an element is positioned in the document and may include top, right, bottom, and left properties.</li>
						<li>Selectors are CSS rules that describe what elements in a document the rule will match. Matching elements get that style applied.</li>
						<li>Advanced CSS Selectors have various ways of combining elements/selectors to style specific elements. Includes things such as the Descendent Combinator, Child Combinator, Adjacent Sibling, Combinator, and General Sibling Combinators.</li>
						<li>The Box Model is that everything in CSS has a box around it and includes content, padding, border, and margin.</li>
						<li>Advanced Box Styling is using the CSS box model and basic CSS layouts, one can make content with unique backgrounds, circles, a cloud, blockquote, etc.</li>
						<li>Media Queries allow you to apply CSS styles depending on the devices general type, screen resolution, or browser viewpage width.</li>
						<li>Transitions in CSS are the properties that define the transition of two states of an element.</li>

						<li>Array Methods are actions that are performed on arrays. These are functions that are stored as object properties.</li>
						<li>String Methods are actions performed on strings.</li>
						<li>Objects are one of JavaScript's data types. It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities.</li>
						<li>Object Methods are a property of an object that is a function.</li>
						<li>Iteration loops offer a quick and easy way of doing things repeatedly.</li>
						<li>Functions are a fundamental building block in JavaScript. It is a procedure. A set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but also takes in an input and generates an output.</li>
						<li>Scoping is the range at which a variable can register in the code which can be global or local. There is other scope terms such as module or block.</li>

						<li>The Window Object is the window interface which represents a window contain a DOM document.</li>
						<li>Document Object Model (DOM) connects the web pages to scripts by representing the structure of a document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree, where the branch is a node that can have events connected to it.</li>
						<li>Querying the DOM is the document method, such as querySelector which returns a static NodeList representing a list of the documents elements that match the specified group of selectors.</li>

						<li>Setting Element Attributes involves setting a the value of an attribute on the specified document. If the attribute exists, then it is updated. get/remove.Attribute().</li>
						<li>Creating DOM Elements requires a method that creates an HTML element by specific tag name. object.createElement('tag name').</li>
						<li>Appending Elements requires a method, appendChild() which adds an element to a specified parent node.</li>
						<li>Intervals and Timers requires a method, setInterval() which repeatedly calls a function or executes a code snippet, with a fixed time delay between each call. This can be removed with clearInterval().</li>
						<li>Event Listeners is a user interaction with the keyboard. Each event describes a single interaction between the user and a key.</li>
						<li>Preventing Default requires a method, preventDefault in which the event interface tells the user agent that if the event does not get explicitly handled, its default action should not be taken as it normally would be.</li>
						<li>Stopping Propagation requires a method of the event interface and prevents the propagation of a current event. stopPropagation().</li>
						<li>Storage is located in the storage interface which provides access to a particular domain session, or local storage.</li>
						<li>Data Attributes allow us to store extra information on standard semantic HTML elements.</li>

					<li>ES6 stands for EcmaScript 6th Edition which the standard that JavaScript is based off. This edition includes let/const keywords, arrow functions, template literals, and more.</li>
					<li>Let is a declaration that is block-scoped as a local variable.</li>
					<li>Const is a declaration that creates block-scoped constants. It cannot be changed through reassignment.</li>
					<li>Arrow Function Expressions are compact alternatives to a traditional function expression. It should not be used as methods. It cannot be used as a constructor and cannot be created as a gen function.</li>
					<li>Template Literals use the backtick key to concatenate text use ${} to substitute values instead of +.</li>
					<li>Asynchronous JavaScript is the ability that allows you to run code while waiting on other processes to complete.</li>
					<li>Callbacks are functions passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.</li>

			<section class="card" id="OOP">
				<h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Objects are datatypes that store various keyed collections and more complex entities.</li>
					<li>Prototype is the base set of properties/mehtods embedded on any object.</li>
					<li>Inheritance is where everything has a relationship to something called a prototype that eventually results in null.</li>
					<li>This refers to the parent object that it is evoked from.</li>
					<li>Polymorphism is one block of code and changing one version based on the inputs we are giving it.</li>
					<li>Method Overloading is when a class has multiple methods by the same name but different parameters.</li>
					<li>Promise is when an object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resting value.</li>
					<li>Callback Function is passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.</li>
					<li>Constructor method is a special method of a class for creating the intiializing an object instance of that class.</li>
					<li>Function Constructors are patterns for creating empty objects and setting to a variable. This pattern is an alternative to factory functions.</li>
					<li>Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being coverted to test cases before software is fully developed and tracks all software dev by repeatedly testing software against all test cases.</li>
					<li>Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of only JavaScript codebase. Sends results quickly.</li>
					<li>Mock Functions allow you to test the links between code by erasing the actual implementation of a function, capturing calls to the function (and the parameters passed in those calls), capturing instances of constructor functions when instantiated with new, and allowing test-time configuration of return values.</li>
					<li>Mocking Modules creates a hypothetical success (or failure) to test the rest of the code that has been written.</li>
					<li>Classes are templates for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. JS classes are built on prototype.</li>
					<li>SubClasses are classes which inherit both the properties of that class without editing the class itself.</li>
